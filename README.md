1. Box Plot:
   - A box plot, also known as a whisker plot, summarizes the distribution of a dataset.
   - It displays the median, quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles), and possible outliers.
   - The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), the line inside the box is the median, and the "whiskers" extend to show the range, excluding outliers.

2. Violin Plot:
   - A violin plot combines elements of a box plot and a kernel density plot.
   - It shows the distribution of the data across different variables by displaying a symmetric plot of the kernel density estimate on each side.
   - This plot provides more information about the distribution's shape and spread compared to a box plot.

3. Linear Regression Least Squares Fit Plot:
   - This plot is used to visualize the relationship between two variables by fitting a line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (differences between observed and predicted values).
   - The line represents the best linear fit, and the scatter points represent the actual data points.

4. Clustered Column Plot:
   - A clustered column plot (or grouped bar chart) displays multiple categories side by side for comparison.
   - Each group has multiple columns that represent different variables or subcategories, allowing comparisons between the groups and the variables within each group.

These plots serve different purposes in data analysis, ranging from distribution and comparison to trends and relationships.
